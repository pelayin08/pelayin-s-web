# BIOGRAPHY

Hi, my name is Pelayo and I am a 17 year old Spanish guy fond of electronics and RF, although I also like audio and sound.


In electronics I usually do things like:

- audio amplifiers
- laser.
- experimenting with leds of different colors and powers, and some homemade flashlight
- oscillators(although this could also fall into RF)
- random useless devices but that are funny

And within electronics I also love high voltage and I made things like tesla coils, flyback inverters...


In RF I am a bit newer but I also do things like:

- listening to the spectrum with an sdr and decoding
- transmitting **IN LOW POWER** at different frequencies
- copying remotes
- transmitting digital signals with cheap modules
- a bit of RFID


I am also an excellent programmer (lie, I know some C++ and that's it)


For a few months now I started to like vacuum tubes and for now I am collecting them, and I hope to use them someday. My favorite tubes are the Soviet ones ☭♥️

It is just a photo generated by chat gpt, I am not a furry(or am I)


At some point in my life I would like to:

- get my amateur radio license(I was going to do it but I got lazy)
- try different gas discharge lamps
- use vacuum tubes

I am short on money, that also limits me from doing things :c


finally here are some useless facts about me:

- I am a bit shy
- the wavelength of my favorite color is 445nm
- my favorite instrument is the synthesizer, and the second favorite the electric guitar
- I love cores and the backrooms
- I find it very practical to make lists(it can be noticed by reading my biography)

and I think that is all you need to know about me :)
